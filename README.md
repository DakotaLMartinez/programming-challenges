# Programming Challenges in JS

I wanted to put together a repository of challenges that I'm working on from various sources on the net. I'm including links to the original challenges in the files themselves. This is partly to document my progress, but also because I want to practice using a TDD approach and want to run the challenges locally for that purpose. I'm using Jest & Testing Library for the tests.
